i need you to generate me some data based on a csv file that im going to send you. Can you do that if i give you instructions?


I am going to send you a csv file with a list of Jokic's games and his stats for those games for his career. I need you to create me a column for each game where there is a projected line (like a sporst betting line) based on his last games. Then, I want you to see if he beats that projected line that you created for that game based on his previous games, and i want you to set a 1 in a new column if he does. otherwise, set a 0. can you do that?
